We’d have to meet you, interact with you, and ask you a ton of uncomfortable questions. And then... We’d refer you to a marriage counselor. We’re not, in any way, qualified to answer that. </span>

                <div>
                    <span>A: Why you asking us when you already have experience with halal dating? Don’t believe me? Then what do you call that relationship you had with the Quran up until you stopped going to Sunday school in your teens? You met with it on the weekend, you were noncommittal, you never looked at the long-term, and now you miss it.</span>

                    <span>A: We’re referring to Western norms of dating, which means physical contact and seclusion prior to marriage.</span>

                <div>
                    <span>A: One second while we consult as a team on this… Yup. We have a consensus. We don’t care. If you don’t like them, ignore them. (Your loss)</span>

                <div>
                    <span>A: Uhhh… well… we bought the domain name first. That probably counts for something, right? And we don’t really give you any of our opinions. We just link to other people whose credentials you can question. Go harass them. We think they’d like that.</span>

                <div>
                    <span>A: For once, we’ll actually give you a serious answer. Check out <a href='http://www.calislamic.com/' target='_blank'>California Islamic University.</a> They’re legit and are also the source of our PDFs on marriage. </span>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: Sweet, sweet, Sadaqa Jarriya (Ongoing Charity). Also, we’ve witnessed too much ignorance in our community over this subject. The smartest people do the dumbest things when it comes to marriage and we’re convinced that it’s because of ignorance. We <em>pray</em> that it’s because of ignorance. </span>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: We have a hypothesis. Muslims really want to conform to Western norms. Why? Because they don’t trust that God knows best, but that’s another story. Anyways, they think that copying a method - dating, sleeping together, moving in before marriage, “falling in love”, proposing on one knee - that has worse than a 50% fail rate will make them happy. </span>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: Because God, Creator of the Heavens and the Earth and everything in between, said so. How do I know He said so? Because He said so in the Quran (not literally, but the injunctions against dating, as it is today, are clear). How do I know the Quran is from God? Now, we’ve got a conversation! This is where you talk about the amazing nature of the Quran. If you don’t know how to talk about this, might be worthwhile to <a href='https://www.quran.com' target="_blank">start educating yourself on it...</a></span>

                    <h5>Q: Bro, I’m living in the 21st century. No one cares what “God” said. What else can I say to people who keep asking about dating?</h5>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: Tell them that in Islam, you don’t concern yourself with the opposite gender (in the romantic sense) until you’re ready to get married. And when you’re ready, you go through a courting process, which involves the parents from step one to ensure everyone’s rights and honor is respected. </span>

                    <h5>Q: What’s so wrong with Zina (intimacy out of wedlock)? We’re two consenting adults and we’re using protection. What’s the harm in that?</h5>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: Okay, so most people on this site probably aren’t asking this, <em>but</em> the Western world is increasingly asking the question so it’s good to try and understand God’s wisdom. Read <a href='http://muslimmatters.org/2015/06/11/the-rationality-of-islamic-sexual-ethics-zina/' target='_blank'>this</a> and realize that there are infinitely more reasons than the ones cited there, but we don’t know them all.

                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: We live in that same, sad world. Read <a href='http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/09/15682/' target='_blank'>this.</a> </span>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: Excellent question, here’s what you need to do: go down to the nearest supermarket, buy some Similac baby formula, mix it with some water, and then drink that until you become a man.</span>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: Istikhara isn’t about a feeling or colors or seeing anything! It’s about God guiding you to what’s best once you’ve made an educated decision. So calm down, stop with the weird superstitions and trust God.</span>

                </div>
                <div>
                    <span>A: Turns out Ahmed ibn Hanbal (founder of the Hanbali school of thought) allowed it so long as you don’t look with lust, but the majority of scholars said you can’t. Don’t act like you follow the Hanbal school all of a sudden. We promise your wife isn’t hiding a mohawk under there (okay, we’re 99.99% sure). </span>
